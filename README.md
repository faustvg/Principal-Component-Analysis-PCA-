The goal of the first task in file pca.py is to make a Principal Component Analysis of the data that 
is giving, the data is a .mat file containing the database with the Pacific Sea Surface Temperatures
(PSST) 1970-2003, analize the data, perform a Singular Value Decompostion (SVD) and visualize the
data to see if the PCA is working appropriatly.
